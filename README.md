## Overview

A convenience tool that makes it easy to generate custom Markdown for badges to put on your documentation or website.

Choose a page, enter your details, and click _Submit_ to generate some Markdown code for you to copy and paste.

External tools are used to actually render badges - mostly using [shields.io](https://shields.io).

## Sample
> Examples of a few badges generated with the app and rendered here on a markdown doc

Note most of the badges at the top of this `README.md` were also generated using this app.

### Social badges

Link to your project. From another project - even paste these in an online forum or your blog.

<div align="center">

[![MichaelCurrin - badge-generator](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=MichaelCurrin&message=badge-generator&color=blue&logo=github)](https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/badge-generator)
[![stars - badge-generator](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/MichaelCurrin/badge-generator?style=social)](https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/badge-generator)
[![forks - badge-generator](https://img.shields.io/github/forks/MichaelCurrin/badge-generator?style=social)](https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/badge-generator)

</div>

### Repo metadata

Add to the top of your `README.md` file. These are tied to your specific repo.

<div align="center">

[![GitHub tag](https://img.shields.io/github/tag/MichaelCurrin/badge-generator?include_prereleases=&sort=semver)](https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/badge-generator/releases/)
[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue)](#license)
[![issues - badge-generator](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/MichaelCurrin/badge-generator)](https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/badge-generator/issues)

</div>

### Generic

Put whatever text you want in this static badge, which is independent of a repo. You can change the color, logo and destination link.

<div align="center">

[![Foo - Bar](https://img.shields.io/badge/Foo-Bar-2ea44f)](#)
![Maintained - yes](https://img.shields.io/badge/Maintained-yes-green)
![Contributions - welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/Contributions-welcome-blueviolet)

</div>

### Packages

An NPM package badge that changes magically when your `package.json` file is updated.

<div align="center">

[![Package - vue](https://img.shields.io/github/package-json/dependency-version/MichaelCurrin/badge-generator/vue?logo=vue.js&logoColor=white)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue)

</div>

### Catalogue

Pre-made badges around languages and tools. Just copy and paste. If you can't find a badge you're looking for, use the Generic badge option to make your own.
